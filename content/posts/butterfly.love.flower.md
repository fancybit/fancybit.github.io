## Butterfly in Love with Flower

Orchid first blooms, luring confused butterflies;

Love sprouts in heart, waiting for the flower-explorer.

Colorful wings flutter, curling jade-like stamens;

Straight it sucks nectar, circling dewdrop fields.

Crimson lips sigh as jade-like juice surges;

Branches sway, leaves droop, fragrance disperses.

Rosy fruit touches pointed pistils softly;

Four seasons pass, love's journey unfolds.
